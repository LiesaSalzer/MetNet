  createStatisticalAdjacencyList

  functionality for thresholding the statistical adjacency matrices (based on
  hard thresholds, or top1, top2 or mean consensus matrix calculation according
  to Hase et al.) to replace removed functions

+ change vignette to markdown
+ add parameter directed in structural to allow for directed networks
+ add parameter values to specify if respectively min, max or all values from
  the corresponding feature pairs (in the upper and lower triangle) should be
  taken in statistical

Changes in version 0.99.24 (2018-10-22)
+ adjust NEWS file to new format according to ?news: 
  o entries are grouped according to version, with version header 
    'Changes in version' at the beginning of a line, followed by a version 
    number, optionally followed by an ISO 8601 format date, possibly 
    parenthesized
  o entries may be grouped according to category, with a category header 
    (different from a version header) starting at the beginning of a line
  o entries are written as itemize-type lists, using one of o, *, - or + as 
    item tag. Entries must be indented, and ideally use a common indentation 
    for the item texts
